## [Queueadmin-Plugin for OTRS](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/mtimm_01/OTRS_TemplateSignatureAddOn)
As my final project I wrote a OTRS-Plugin which brings client capabilities administrating the response templates and email signatures. It allows you to grant queueadmins. They can edit this templates and signatures using a new main menu entry.

Because my university and I like open source we've published the sources here:

## [F.A.Q.-Tool (_Sciebo_)](http://sciebo.de/de/hilfe/problemloesung/)
As a part of my apprenticeship at the University of Münster I wrote a question and answer system (_FAQ_). Users having a problem can answer a few questions so they can be directed to the correct support team according to the problem.

## [Explain Sort Order – Plugin for PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/F4FF595C-D39D-4036-A446-57C91ABE6B31%40exchange.wwu.de)
I extended the output of the `EXPLAIN` command in postgreSQL databases so it gives information about the sort order of the used indexes.

## [Website of the Kolpingsfamilie Laer](https://kolping-laer.de/)
I am the maintainer and developer of the website of the Kolpingsfamilie in Laer. It basicly runs on WordPress. But in addition it had a self written calendar function to manage the events.
