## Photography
For some time now, I've been getting my hands on a small selection of cameras.
As I haven't been doing this for very long, I'm discovering the field
of photography more and more for myself. When I learned that my mother
had her own photo lab over twenty years ago to develop her films, it made
quite an impression on me. Despite my love for old or classic methods, I
have to admit that having my own photo lab is not interesting for me as
I only own a film camera. I also believe that it's helpful to see the
results immediately when you try it out and not only after a few minutes/hours
when the film has been fully developed.

## Digital night photography
I am more concerned about digital photography. The subsequent image processing
is of course very attractive, but I haven't done as much in this area as I
perhaps should. I prefer to go out at night to take pictures, since only when
the sun is no longer in the sky are there so many more interesting motifs
(_in my opinion_). Of course, I always try my hand at the starry sky because
it's not that easy. If the ISO value can't be turned up that high, you almost
have no choice but to increase the exposure time. Of course, I almost always
have the aperture open to the maximum. With exposure times of over 30 seconds,
however, you can see the earth's rotation, as the star trails suddenly become
visible, which is something you actually want to avoid. You can counteract
this with appropriate "tripods" that move with you, but these are simply
far too expensive and not worth it for me.

But it's not just the stars that make a good motif. I was in Münster a few
days ago. There is relative light pollution there (_as in every city_), but
from a parking garage I know you have a great overview of the city and the
traffic also produces beautiful pictures, for example when you can only
make out the blurred traces of light.

## My previous cameras
This is the list of cameras I've worked with in the past to collect some experience:

 - [Olympus OMD em5 mark ii](https://www.olympus.de/site/de/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m5_mark_ii/index.html)
    - Expensive
    - Big featureset (_too big for me_)
 - [Canon EOS 350D](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_350D)
    - Old (_ca. 2005_)
    - No video mode (_not relevant for taking photos_)
    - Highest possible ISO value is 1.600
 - [Canon EOS 77D](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_77D)
    - Higher ISO range
    - Video mode

## Lock with my old camera
Contrary to my earlier expectations, it is still possible to take contemporary
photos with a camera that is almost 15 years old. It's all a question of
the correct setting, the lens used and post-processing (_which I still
can't do_). For example, I don't think this picture of the lock in Münster
is bad at all. You can also see here that I like to play with long exposure
times

## Christmas light exhibition at the zoo
The [all-weather zoo in Münster](https://www.allwetterzoo.de/) normally closes
relatively early in winter. In winter 2019/20, however, you could walk through
the zoo almost every evening until 10 pm. However, there were no animals to
see at that time, but rather elaborate light installations. Of course, I had
to take a photo or two of this. The proportion of good photos is still
negligible compared to the total number of photos taken. However, this
picture stands out because it looks as bright as day and the bright
light and long exposure time turn a normal disco ball into a kind of star.
The reflections result in circular trails of light, just as happens with
the stars in the night sky if they are photographed for too long.
