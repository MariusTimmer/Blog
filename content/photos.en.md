For some time I have had access to a small selection of cameras again and again. Since I haven't done this for so long, I'm discovering the field of photography for myself again. When I found out that my mother had her own [photo lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_laboratory) (_over twenty years ago_) to develop her films, I was quite impressed. In spite of my love for old and classic things, I have to admit that an own photo lab is not interesting for me, since I only own one film camera. I also think that it is helpful to see the results directly when taking photos, not after a few minutes/hours when the film has been developed.


Digital night photography
-------------------------
Most of my interest is reserved for digital photography. The subsequent image editing is of course very attractive, but I haven't done as much in this area as I should perhaps. I prefer to go out at night to take pictures. Because only when the sun is no longer in the sky, there are (in my opinion) so many more interesting motifs. Of course I try myself again and again in the starry sky, because it is not so easy. If the ISO value cannot be turned so high, you have almost no other choice than to increase the exposure time. Of course, the aperture is almost always open. But with exposure times of more than 30 seconds you can see the rotation of the earth, because the star orbits suddenly become visible, what you actually want to avoid. Against it one can proceed indeed with appropriate "tripods" which move along, however, these are simply much too expensive and it is simply not worth it to me.

That is why I focus on digital photography. The image editing is of course very attractive, but I haven't done as much in this area as I should perhaps. I prefer to go out at night to take pictures.

At exposure times of more than 30 seconds, however, the Earth's rotation can be seen, since the star orbits suddenly become visible, which one actually wants to avoid.
You can do this with "_tripods_" that move with you, but they are simply too expensive and it is not worth it.

But not only the stars make a good motive. A few days ago I was in Münster. There is a relative light pollution (_as in every city_), but from a parking garage I know you have a great overview of the city and also the traffic ergbit nice pictures, if you can only see the blurred light tracks.

Used Cameras
-----------------
I was able to collect some experience with the following cameras:

 - [Olympus OMD em5 mark ii](https://www.olympus.de/site/de/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m5_mark_ii/index.html)
    - Expensive
    - Many functions (_way to many for me - yet_)
 - [Canon EOS 350D](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_350D)
    - Old (_ca. 2005_)
    - No video recording
    - Highest ISO value is 1.600
 - [Canon EOS 77D](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_77D)
    - High ISO range and video function
