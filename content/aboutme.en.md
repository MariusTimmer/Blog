## Personal
There isn't much to say about me. Most of the things are already told in my posts. I am Marius Timmer, born 1994 in [Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia), a region within west Germany.
After finishing my apprenticeship to became a software developer (*aka Coder, Hacker or whatever*) I started my full time job at the University of MÃ¼nster. When I am not at work or codeing private I like to travel with my friends having no certain target.

## About this Blog
I started this little blog to test the software [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which procudes static websites. I used WordPress before for a long time. But this alternative allows me to use my loved terminal and be independent of any database system in the background. This is why I prefere Hugo now. Additionally I do not have to use that much webspace for it. The only limitation is that dynamicly generated contents via PHP are very rare now. But in context of security this is a good thing.


## Contact
In case you want to contact me (*And I do not mean the kind of contact my spam is full with*) you can use email. Usually it is easyer to reach me with a email instead of a WhatsApp message or something because I do not like to answer my annoying cell phone all the time it rings me.

I am able to read HTML mails but I do prefer to use `PlainText`. So you should consider using it. This mail account is hosted by myself which is why your mail provider could deny receiving my mails. Keep that in mind when contacting me. I suggest to use PGP / GnuPG when communicating.
