The winter keeps my busy
------------------------

As we all know, winter is the cold season. Thats why I often have to think
about my Audi 80. After the [door lock froze up](/post/eingefrorenesschloss/)
the other day, I couldn't see through my freezing windshield now.

A few nights ago I drove to [MÃ¼nster](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster)
in the dark. Because of the low temperatures my windshield was frozen with
a light frozen veil. At every red traffic light, I wiped the windshield
clear again to keep the view free. You can imagine that this is very
unpleasant not only because it looks absolutely stupid, but also because
you always risk being seen and stopped by the police.


Antifreeze alone is not always enough
-------------------------------------
The next day I bought five liters of windshield wiper water with added
antifreeze. Some people might say that it would be much better to buy
distilled water and antifreeze separately and add them in the required
ratio. But even if it sounds unbelievable, I was simply interested in
finding a quick solution. And in the store where I was, they only had
ready to use mixtures. That should be completely sufficient for me.
When I started to use the wiper on the wind shield I realized that
nothing came out which was really sad.

I heared the pump loud and clearly. Thus, it could not be the reason for
the dryness and I knew that it would not be an expensive matter. After a few
attempts I could smell the antifreeze quite clearly. The windshield wipers
moved up and down like crazy and moved over the windshield. So the windshield
wiper water was pumping and also leaving the reservoir. After two minutes,
I noticed that all the wiper water was being pumped, but not through the
hood. From the driver's seat, you could clearly see the wiper water flowing
under the hood. I noticed a small puddle under my car.

A look under the hood revealed: the hose was leaking. The hose is held
directly to the hood from below with two large suction cups. However, the
hose not only had a small hole, but was simply no longer in one of the
suction cups. As a result, the water was simply pumped halfway out of
the hose directly under the hood. Fortunately, the wiping water did not
reach the battery. But not much would have been missing. That would have been
very bad.


Cheap but effective repair
--------------------------
I saw that the hose was easy to put back into the suction cup. However, it
would only be a matter of time before it would come out again. So I headed
to the hardware store and picked up some small [cable ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tie)
and some [heat shrink tubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-shrink_tubing).
To my surprise, the hose was also "_only_" tied in place with a cable tie
in the other places, so there wasn't much movement anymore. So I also tied
the cable tie at that point. But before I did that, I put the shrink tubing
over the spot, put everything back together and then heated the tubing.
Within seconds it pulled together and connected the parts perfectly.

Even if the cable tie alone would probably have done its job well (_as it
held in the other places as well_), I find the solution with the heat
shrink tubing still better. Now I have the certainty that the hose only
does not remain in place, but is also sealed. Especially with the car
battery in mind, I now feel even better than before. I intentionally use
the word "_better_" and not "_safer_" because I did not feel unsafe before
really.

Finally, I operated the lever for the wipers, heard how the pump pumped
the wiping water again, nothing splashed out of the hose under the hood
and the wipers finally got the windshield de-iced and clean again. Even
if these are always only small things, I am happy every time I can repair
my car myself. Still, I wouldn't mess around with the engine, brakes or
other critical parts of the Audi 80. The fact that I regularly remove
my steering wheel to avoid standing in the dark is enough for me. But
I'll write about that story another time.
