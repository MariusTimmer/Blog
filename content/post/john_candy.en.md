This might be a bit random for you but I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Candy" title="Wikipedia article about Candy" rel="external">John Candy</a>. He has passed away before I was born. But when my dad raised me we have spend a lot of time watching comedy or family friendly action movies from the 80s. Sometimes we watched three or even four movies a day when my sister and I visited my dad during the weekend. This did something to us and I guess the taste of music and even more movies I like today is based on this time together.

## What I saw in him
One of the reasons why Candy was special to me was that he had visual similarities with my father, who also never was a slim person. As a kid I always saw a version of my father acting in those movies. They both were very lovely in the roles they had and always were like "_a rock in the waves_" - as we say in Germany. Both of them had this calming side. Of course both were able to be angry but never without any reason.

## The movies I grew up with
Since my dad never liked "Home alone", I have never watched that movie. The first movies I recognized Candy in were Cannonball Fever, Blues Brothers (_one of my favorite movies_), Little Shop of Horrors (_awesome movie!_), Spaceballs (_one of my favorites as well_) and Uncle Buck - just to list a few of them. In my eyes every movie gets better if I see Candy - even in the smallest side roles.

There is no special event which made me think about John Candy today, but since my dad passed away in January I spend a lot of time thinking about him and sometimes I see John Candy which might be a bit weird - but that's okay I guess. I miss both of them.
