summary: "RSS feeds might look like a technology from the 2000s (_because it is_) and hard to use. But in my eyes they are the key to the best online experience which isn't dictated by the algorithm."

## I've Watched a Video
I've just watched the [latest Technology Connections video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA) on YouTube. I watch most of his videos and really like them since they are always a great start to a new rabbit hole.

## What the Video Was About (_very short_)
This time, he spoke about how we are increasingly letting _the algorithms_ choose what we see on the internet, which is obviously a bad thing. I think one of the biggest issues might be the danger of doom scrolling and wasting a lot of time doing nothing. He explains that there is a [personal feed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions) which only shows videos from channels you are subscribed to. I have to admit that I didn't know that. I used this to check which channels I was subscribed to and made a few modifications. After realizing that I had indeed lost a lot of time watching videos I didn't even want to see in the first place, I hope to use that personalized feed more often now.

## My Thoughts
Some of my friends might have heard before that I really like RSS feeds. They allow me to only read news I really want to read. No clickbait titles or even ads. It is the feeling of freedom that amazes me so much. I am in control of the feeds I am "subscribing" to by putting the feeds' URLs into my RSS readerâ€”that's it. No suggested articles about things I am not interested in.

I love podcasts. One more cool thing about RSS is that it is the default format for publishing podcasts, which means I can not only subscribe to my favorite news or blogs but also to podcast series! If social media platforms supported RSS (_which wouldn't be a hard thing to do_), it would be pretty easy to add the posts of my favorite people there too. I've heard that some platforms already support it, but I guess most providers like Twitter or Meta just have no reason to support RSS since it would only move people away from those doom-scrolling platforms.

Last night, I added a few of my favorite news, blogs, and podcasts to my RSS reader (_Akregator on PC and Feeder on my phone_). I am super curious to see how this will affect my screen time and even the amount of traffic on my devices. I will report back as soon as I have more information about that.

## My Blog as RSS feed
Just in case you already use a RSS reader yourself, this is where you can find my posts: [feed](/en/index.xml)
