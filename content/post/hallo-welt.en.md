## Hello world!
After some consideration about whether it really makes sense to continue
writing my small blog in handwritten HTML files, I decided that it might
be a good idea to switch to a static website generator. That's why I've
now opted for [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/). In the coming time, it will
become clear whether and how much better Hugo is.

It's also nice that I can finally use simple `Markdown` here. Although I've
noticed that with this theme, the following elements do not work in the
preview or overview of the posts:
 - **Bold** text
 - > Paragraphs
 - `Monospace` font
 - Lists

But that doesn't change the fact that I already really like it!

See you soon - Until next time!

### May 2024 update
All those limitations are void now. Hugo and I have moved on and I optimized
my setup. I am still (_and again_) super happy with my solution.
