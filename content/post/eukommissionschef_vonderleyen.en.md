Something seems to be wrong in the EU. If you have been following me here for some time, you should know that I don't think much of [Manfred Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Weber) (see [this](/en/post/uploadfilter_demo_koeln/)). So I wasn't very angry when they said the other day that Parliament wouldn't propose him for the post of Head of the Commission. But I was very surprised when [Frans Timmermanns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Timmermans) was also rejected. At first I thought to myself, it may be quite refreshing that not only the proposals of the large groups were waved through, but perhaps someone from the small groups could also come.

But when they published the infiormation that [Ursula von der Leyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen) will be proposed, I was not even angry anymore, but just disappointed. I don't see what this woman has achieved in recent years, which would qualify her for this position. There is still, of course, the possibility that this proposal of the Parliament will not be adopted, but I do not believe that the proposal will be rejected. What this means for the future will be very interesting.
