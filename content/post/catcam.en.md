When our cat got babies, I plugged a webcam and a PC to the internet so I am able to see what happens at home. This is very useful when I am at the grocery store or just working in office. Additionally a lot of people got the link in the meantime so I kinda have to keep this service up for you all. I call this: The Trueman Show.
