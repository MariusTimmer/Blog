New ideas
=========
That I didn't had much time in the past months to shoot new videos is probably already noticeable. As well as the fact that my most recent videos are something like more and more strange experiments. On the other hand, I had intended to try out some random things from the beginning. Undoubtedly I do so. But I noticed that this is perhaps not the best idea. But now I have an idea again, which I think (_at least for now_) could at least be "interesting".

To say that I want to shoot a documentary would be a bit big. It's more like I want to do interviews with some people who need the internet for different reasons. I want to give some insight into the way these people work, to show what tasks the Internet can be used for and what it can have an impact on. I hope to start shooting soon. The result (_if there ever will be_) you will see here, too.
