Winter is coming

In mid-December, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that winter is dropping the
temperatures, and it freezes again at night. As a Audi 80 driver the first thing
you notice is that the roads are slippery. Then, if you have a car without
<abbr title="Anti-lock braking system">ABS</abbr> in the case of a braking,
even good winter tires are no longer much help. With summer tires it would be
(_of course_) much worse, but from various braking processes I can
tell that the wheels will stand still even when slightly braking and
one you quickly stand in the middle of the intersection instead of on the
stop line.

When I wanted to drive to work this morning, I quickly realized that I couldn't
get into the Audi. Not only streets get slippery in winter, but door locks
freeze. In the past, I could get **frozen locks relatively easily and quickly
with my breath warm enough** so that the door could be unlocked again. However,
today that wasn't enough.

Does a lighter help?
--------------------
Since we heat with fireplaces at home, I often have a lighter in my pocket.
I tried to heat the metal of the key with it and thus be able to use the lock
again. But in my opinion, this is anything but an optimal solution. On the
one hand, I have to be careful that the key doesn't get too hot so that the
plastic handle comes off, but on the other hand, it still has to get hot
enough so the lock in the door warms up enough. I tried it once,
but was unsuccessful.


The water boiler always helps
-----------------------------
So I came back to the method that always works: **The water boiler**. Just went
home again, briefly warm up water (_but do not bring to a boil_) and then
with small cool down phases again and again let the warm water run over the
lock from the outside. Of course, you have to be careful here, too. If you
pour boiling water over your door, don't be surprised if the metal or paint
doesn't take it so well. In my case, the handle itself is also made of
plastic, which additionally speaks against pouring 1.5 liters of boiling
water over it. At least if I plan to still use the handle afterwards.

After this small (_but actually also widespread and well-known_) "_life hack_",
the door could be unlocked easily, and I could continue to scrape the windows
free. And no: I didn't do that with the water, of course. I'm not quite that
stupid. Assuming that the glass windows would survive this undamaged, they
would freeze within less than two minutes. And more solidly than before.
