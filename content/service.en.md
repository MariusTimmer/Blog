What I can do
=============
For some years now I have been working in the public sector as a software developer. Primarily I take care of the development and maintenance of our web applications as well as the operation of the databases. As you can see in my [references](/en/references/), I also built the websites of the [Kolping Family Laer](https://kolping-laer.de/) or of [independent entrepreneurs](https://tanjakoester.de/).

Tools
-----
Usually I use the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) software with some extensions ir required, as this is very easy for the customer to use. Especially if new content (_offers, blogs, etc._) is to be published regularly, it is important that I don't have to be commissioned and active again and again, but that I can do it myself if possible. However, I can also respond to individual wishes. If, for example, you only want to have a small website as a kind of business card with contact form, I can set it up / develop it without such a big tool as WordPress and thereby fully respond to your wishes.

Uncomplicated
-------------
Since I'm not a big friend of bureaucracy, I like short communication lines. It may seem a bit old-fashioned when I say that I prefer email contact, but of course I am generally available through all communication channels (_except Facebook_): [Email](mailto:admin@mariustimmer.de), Twitter: [@marius_timmer](https://twitter.com/marius_timmer), Instagram: [@timmer94](https://instagram.com/timmer94). So if you already have a concrete idea for a project in mind, or if you're open to ideas, just write to me so we can sit down. I'm pretty sure we can do a cool thing together.

So if you are interested in building your own website, feel free to contact me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
